  This function really does three things:

    3. "Partial reduction" of these batches by sending this through the
       "intro metrics" step.
    3. The "normal" combining of MetricVariables.

  What we really want to do is conceptually the following:
  Predictions | GroupByKey() | KeyAwareBatchElements()
              | ParDo(IntroMetrics()) | CombineValues(CombineMetricVariables()).

  but there's no way to KeyAwareBatchElements in Beam, and no way to do partial
  reductions either. Hence, this CombineFn has to do the work of batching,
  partial reduction (intro metrics), and actual combining, all in one.

  We do this by accumulating FeaturesPredictionsLabels in the combine state
  until we accumulate a large enough batch, at which point we send them
  through the "intro metrics" step. When merging, we merge the metric variables
  and accumulate FeaturesPredictionsLabels accordingly. We do one final
  "intro metrics" and merge step before producing the final output value.
